Iterating ideas requires time. To squeeze every minute out of our workdays we have to be fast. 


Dealing with interface mockups requires constant drawing and sketching, and worrying to draw the screen appropriate proportions when explaining the idea  just isn't right. So, I prepared a special grid with smartphone outlines to be printed and used for this soul purpose.

Placing elements onto the display is easy. With the help of the grid, interfaces can be built faster  and you don't have to worry about proportions or other details that may disturb the work process. The sheet is free for download and is available to everyone. Happy mockup-ing!
