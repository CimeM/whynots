Toastmasters Ljubljana a part of the international network of non profit edu organization. Toastmasters International already selected its signature branding. Apparent in their magazine, workbooks and of course, the website, it gives a clear guideline to all other entities. Not stepping out of their agenda, the new website has the same outline, colour palette and similar UX. 
Communication with the board revealed the trouble points which a modern website could solve. Problem-solving approach yield multiple sets of instructions, advanced tools and connections  within the twitter bootstrap framework design. A careful approach revealed very little maintenance subjects.

Addition to the website was a site for annual events - Marathons. These events happen twice a year and information is due to be changed respectively.  


Brand assets

The logo is a rounded blue circle with organization's name falling out on both sides. We didn't put the logo on the site but it is included several times along the page, one being the wallpaper on the index page.


Navbar has a gradient of lighter red (#892C3B) to darker red (#69212d). Darker grayscale image with vinjeting effect and white text ontop foms an identical configuration as the official page.

Font was easy. Its Arial. This time old font shows a classic approach to branding.

Footer, social media icons and that 4 column design were replaced with newer and cleaner items. Footer is white, social media icons dark grey and equiped with 3 column design.
