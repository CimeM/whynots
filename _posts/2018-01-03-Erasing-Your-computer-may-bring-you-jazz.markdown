If you have a computer, it's obvious you store your photos, diplomas and other will-do-it-later things on the disk drive. If your drive would get erased, you would probably regret not saving a copy of it.  All that mess represents everything we did over time. It is valuable to us. Some of it probably has some passwords or social security numbers sticking out. Would you regret losing it due to accidental erasing manoeuvre? Well, I certainly did.

I was fiddling with some project I want ed to load to the Raspberry. The SD card had to be erased. Since I had trouble with my Macintosh, I tried with Linux. Booted from a USB stick it promised to be quick indeed. Once G-Parted was opened, I glanced at Sheldon proposing to  Amy  (The Big Bang Theory). The confirmation box appeared, pressed enter, quickly returning my attention to Amy.

Once again I glanced at my computer, the success box appeared. Click "OK". And as I was turning to the tv I noticed the amount of space free on my SD card 249GB. That's a lot.... 
Looking at tv again. Wait! what? My SD has 250GB? No way! It would have been much more expensive.

O F**k! I just deleted my drive!

I booted the computer without the key and I just stared at the blank screen for a minute. Everything was gone. Photos, videos, projects, masters degree, illustrations.... Gone in a spiral of the fast digital blackout. It's like someone just turned off the tv. I kept staring there but had to realise it was really off.
I buried my face in my hands. And just stopped the rush all the screens put me into.

I slowly realised what an idiot I was. But luckily, I have all the important things on the cloud. You see, every time I saved something on my drive, it got picked up and saved in the cloud. I have Evernote, Dropbox, Google drive and Git full of my projects. The relief slowly started to wash the nervousness away. I put my laptop through installation and fell in bed.

Next morning I set in front of the screen again. I turned it on and realised how fast fresh the OS really felt. It was not laggy and actually really responsive. The new stock wallpaper introduced the out-of-the-store feeling again. I was not opening my laptop. It was a curtain opening to a new show. A new chapter. I felt like I was sitting in the cinema and the reflectors just dimmed and the show started to fill my ears with jazz and dancers appeared in front. Wow! I was amazed how fresh that felt. I was happy for my recent discovery, but still sobering up form the idiotic thing I did. Gigs from the cloud clogged the internet bandwidth for a few hours. At 10 everything was fine again. Finally, relief. The smooth jazz continues.

Besides from the fresh feeling, this also meant a new start. Conscious data organization became the new normal. Since I was already used to clouds, I needed to seal the promise. From here on out, data belongs to the cloud! 

At the end, I lost a few photos, some website backups and a few illustrations. Nothing too dramatical. Everything else was already waiting for me on my drive.
