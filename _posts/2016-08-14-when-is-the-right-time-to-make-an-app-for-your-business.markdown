If you are planning to establish a mobile presence with your customers, you have probably come across two options: Mobile website and Mobile Application (App). They both look very similar at first glance but actually differ quite a lot. The intended purpose is to consider everything before making a decision. Your users will notice, so it's worth spending the time to make the right one.

## What is the difference between a mobile website and mobile app?
A mobile website is similar to any other website. Written with web-based languages, it will behave as a website. Accessible over the internet, its content will be transferred over (3G, LTE or WiFi) and displayed on a smaller screen within the limited browser environment.

A mobile website is really good for bringing text /images content to a mobile display really fast. But the advantage is its biggest dissadvantage. With a mobile website, you are limited to the content you can use on any website: Text, image, video, linked connections, addresses etc., you can not do much more than that. 


With apps however, you can do more than that. Applications are powerful software based programs, that can run on your customers devices. Downloaded from the App store, Google play store or other, they deliver the most personalised experience.


## When is the right time to build an app?


The decision to build an app comes from your end goals. It's obvious that games should be built as an app and not as a website. But if your plan is to provide mobile-compatible content to the widest possible audience a website is the option for you. Needless to say that not every case is the same, it is your understanding of your customers needs and your goals to provide the best options for your customers, which will influence your decision.


A mobile website should be considered first, before deciding for an app. Apps are made for a specific purpose and usually, cover what browsers can't.

## Mobile website advantages
 - Access (Mobile websites are accessible instantly.) Your users have to know the address of your website to open it. Apps need to be downloaded from the store.

- Compatibility (Your mobile website can be viewed by any device.) You don't have to worry about the platform. Web browsers are available on all devices. Apps, on the other hand, have to be built for a specific platform: Android, iOS, BlackBerry etc.

- Instant adjustments (Websites can be changed quickly) Using Content Management Systems, content of the website can be changed instantly. Some apps can also change their content, but are more restricted. And allow changes only on version updates.

- Discovery (Web sites can be found easily.) Mobile websites can be linked from everywhere on the internet, displaying the content instantly helps to speed up the process of content discovery.

- Reach (Mobile websites have broader reach.) Because of reasons mentioned above, you will reach a broader audience with your mobile website than with an app.

- Lifecycle (Websites can not be deleted by users) Unlike the apps, websites are accessible always, you are in instant control of the published content.

- A Mobile website can be an app. Web-based apps are fast to build and deployed onto multiple platforms in a single step. This can also be a test step before going fully native into an app.

- Time and cost - (Mobile websites are easier and less expensive) Mobile websites can be built by web developers, a lot of code is reused. However, mobile experience differs from desktop or laptop experience. Rethinking what and why your users need when visiting a mobile website before you launch into development.

- Support and sustainability. Upgrades, updates, testing is less expensive when comparing a website with an app.

## Reasons to build a mobile App

Having fewer benefits over mobile websites, apps are still a popular option for users. There is a number of cases where users will appreciate having an app over a website. Basically, covering one of the following cases, your business qualifies for an app:

- Interactivity. For interactive experience (games) apps are the number one option. You control the space on your users' screen space.

- Regular usage / Personalization. Users install apps when they plan using them regularly and personalise their experience. Consider Evernote. The app enables great personalization.

- Complex calculations and/or Reporting - Data manipulation, complex calculations, complex visualisations, reports are reasons to consider an app. Web site servers would be overloaded if considered options would be done remotely. Banking, investment apps are a great example.

- Native functionality - processing. Smartphones are packed with sensors, they have high-resolution cameras and screens, their processing power grows by the month. It would not be wise to skip that opportunity.

- Offline mode. Apps are present even in offline mode. Access to content is stil available

- Notifications. Apps can send notifications to users. Dedicated users will set up notifications on their phone to be the first who receive the information.

As with any project, you want to get an optimal return on your investment. Avoid unnecessary use of resources for building an app for the task that can be accomplished with a mobile website. Or in other words: Don't use a cannon to kill a mosquito.

## Conclusion:
the app vs web question will always remain a great question. Running an organisation is by itself a great deal that requires a great amount of time. Being mobile-present mainly for marketing purposes, or your goal is to deliver content and establish a broad mobile presence, found by search engines, and shared quickly, then your option is mainly on the side of a mobile web page.
However, having an interactive engagement with your users, or to provide a specific functionality or to cover what browsers can't then an app is a logical choice.
