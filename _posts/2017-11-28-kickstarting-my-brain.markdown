Whether you just started on a project or you’ve gazed a long path with it, you had to find a name for it. For me, this was the name of my new website. This is the name I will identify all my future projects with. However, I don’t have time for the soul-searching mantra. And, as if that wasn’t enough, I had to find the domain name that was available. What I found surprised me. I will be turning my attention to this method for future projects as well.

I turned to google and typed my inquiry: “how to find a domain name”. Million results. They advise turning to synonyms, word generators or funky names like “thisismynewwebsiterighthere.com”. While these are good enough for some, it has no value at my end. This way I’m just entrusting someone else or some bot that isn’t aware even of itself. Sure this may be fun, but it’s not representative.

But I actually went that path. But all that happened is time passed by. My brain surged from all the ideas that didn’t fit. At the end of week one(!), I had nothing. Reserving a plane ticket for my soul-search became tempting. I give up! Let’s just copy something… :poop:

Later that week I remembered what I was thought by my labcoat mentors. We had a similar problem, but with electric circuits. We had to wear protective glasses for this tests:

To identify a mysterious black box. To do that we had to stimulate it with a signal. This way the box would respond, with another kind of signal, that hold information about the box identity. We transformed the signal into the mathematical function and voila! We identified the box. FYI, this is basically what advanced reverse engineering looks like. Its all about the black box.

Instead of zapping my brain I decided to input the signal of creativity. Now I have to find that stimulation signal for my brain.

The input has to be a sandwich of rainbows :rainbow: and magical creatures :horse:, to output something worthwhile.

Back to the internet; Who is best with words? Writers. Where do they get most creative? On book covers. Mind the saying: Don’t judge the book by the cover. Face it most of us do it.

There I found a list of book titles that spark creativity. I listed them by the popularity and creativity.

The way this would work is for me to read the titles and try to write down the ideas I’d come up with.

The first few titles have to be humorous. Because humour is known to bring down those mental walls we built.

I read them one by one. And almost hearing how neurons started to fire, I was pulled into a storm of ideas and could not get out. This can be addictive I thought to myself. What took me a couple of weeks ended up being finished in a couple of minutes! Still amazed how cool this idea is, I’ve included the titles for you to read. I know I will be using this method for the multitude of challenges in the future. Don’t overdose.
