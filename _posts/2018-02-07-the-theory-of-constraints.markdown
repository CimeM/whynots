You have probably seen a factory before. You probably drove by one today. From the outside it looks dull, because iron curtains hide the marvel that is going on inside. 

I was lucky enough to work at a factory before i even graduated. It was a paper plant. They shipped in cellulose and turn it into paper for all sorts of labels. But all the knowledge about technical part of the plant didn’t prepare me for the Theory of constraints. 

While engineers worry about how machines operate and their health status, upper management deals with the operations process like the throughput maximisation, efficiency, profitability. For a young engineer these terms sound like meaningless words, they actually consider the future of the plant itself. This was a great opportunity for me, to sit on a managers chair and observe the process, while consuming the information and making sense of it.

This article was created as a research piece to the theory of Constraints proposed by Eliyahu M. Goldratt & Jef Cox in the book "The Goal”. And at the same time apply the knowledge to a simulation that considers management perspective as the main driver to reach the goal. The simulation is actually a strategic game that involves people, their motivations and as well considers tangible assets as a goal.

### The novel: The goal
The main character is Alex Rogo, his mission is to turn the factory away from debt and ensure profit and survival of his company. The book reveals how the Theory of Constraints can be applied in management to alleviate bottlenecks. The book also describes how to apply the concepts in real life. It is used in management colleges to teach students about the importance of strategic capacity planning and constraint management. [Time Magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)) listed the book as one of "The 25 Most Influential Business Management Books. More: [Wiki: The Goal(novel)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goal_(novel))

Some quotes from the book: 

"Throughput is the rate at which the system generates money through sales."

"Inventory is all the money that the system has invested in purchasing things which it intends to sell."

"Operational expense  is all the money the system spends in order to turn inventory into throughput."

"Inventory are machines, tools, estate. The whole plant is an investment that can be sold.”


### The simulation: Fallout Shelter
(http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout_Shelter) announced in 2015. The game allows building an underground vault and becoming overseer of its inhabitants. The game includes in-app payment that allows time shortcuts for some of its processes. The goal is to reach 200 inhabitants while stabilising their resource consumption and develop their skills. The game owns unpredictable factors, that appear randomly and have to be addressed immediately. We can call these stability tests. The simulation is a close representation to the example in the book, but still needed some deduction to identify some of its traits.

The game operates as a manufacturing facility, where bottlenecks and optimisations are possible. The game challenges the player by building a stable entity and testing it by random events that can compromise stability.

The goal of the game actually wasn't announced by the creators but it does provide the multitude of areas for improvement. Mainly concerning the inhabitants. The vault has its size limit, and so do the skills levels.


### Room positioning strategy.

#### Building array
At the beginning the overseer is presented to a line of 15 dwellers at the gate of the vault. They are at low levels and don’t have special traits skilled. First modest steps involve building the basic necessities for the vault. Build a power plant, water treatment and diner facilities and assign dwellers to them. You can group maximum of 3 rooms, and the allowed width allows for 9 rooms in a row. If you want to maximise the speed dwellers move in the vault, it is most efficient to build two rows of elevators in the centre of the vault. My configuration has exactly the configuration. I’ve built 2 elevator columns in the middle allowing 2 room in between and 3 rooms on each side.

#### Build-in rows
Build resource producing facilities in a row. This way you can max out the use of mr. Handy in the future. Living quarters can occupy a single row in your vault (it will be more than that). Just focus on the rows.

#### Build for protection
Build producing and/or training facilities at the same level as vault door. This way visits from raiders, and other wasteland animals will be short. Put living quarters to the 3rd level or 2nd level if possible.

#### Build for future upgrades
At the beginning of the game, there are not many options where to build. But as game evolves, new rooms begin to unlock. Including the final Nuca-cola factory. Here is the catch. The upgraded 3 room version would feed 100 people With food and water. So plan your food & water generating facilities in advance to be removed later in time only to be replaced with other facilities.

#### Do build, only from necessity
The solution to satisfy the need, you have to expand capabilities. Bottlenecks will occur. You have two options. You can build another set of resource producing facilities or upgrade existing ones. My strategy was to improve what I already had because building more facilities can increase our power needs. Which is another resource. Build new facilities only out of complete necessity and if you have maxed out all the rooms available. The vault will be easier to maintain.

However, bottlenecks can be managed. With prioritization system. For example. If you have only one school facility in the vault, you can train only the ones that need intelligence to produce resources better/faster. You can train others once the high priority individuals are trained.

If the bottleneck is the resource factory, energy for example. We can assign dwellers with greater Strength and Lick levels to it, or we can change their outfit for an extra boost.

#### Focus on your resources
Energy, water and food levels are the most important levels to keep eyes on. The bar on the levels is your demand/production ratio. If it’s on the left, you are producing more than consuming, on the right, you are consuming more than producing. Both extremes are bad. Keep it in the middle.

### Statistical fluctuations 
(some events are unpredictable - you cannot predict how many eggs will the cook spend in his day, in contrast, you can count how many seats are in the restaurant - capacity)

Food and water consumptions are unpredictable
But production isn’t. Simulation provides a bar at the resource levels, to predict if development is sufficient.
Some rough estimations express that dwellers consume 21units/hour (food and water). 100 dwellers would spend 2100units of food per hour This is a local minimum because spending would increase due to healing, growing, pregnancy, exercise, work status, health status, wasteland time etc. These are all estimations made by players because there is no official source of information. In real life, spending would be calculated with resource capacity level and the demand for the resource. And in my theory, this is the ratio between plant production and the number of dwellers. Inventory would ensure fluctuation suppression. This is what the resource levels at the top are. Inventories with a bar symbolising the demand/production ratio.

The best way is to over-produce living resources a bit. Also, position higher-level dwellers closer to the vault door. This way they can quickly eliminate incoming random visitors and protect the rest. You will spend fewer resources on equipment as well. 


### Dependent events 
(a single process has to finish first to enable others to start)

Dependent events also exist in the simulation. Dwellers have to be #blessed (high “L" level) to increase their success rate at the factory. They have to have good health, to reach high happiness levels. And health depends on food and water resources. 

Production is of food and water depend on energy levels. If energy is low, some facilities just shut down. Imagine how bad it would be if you had maxed out diners and insufficient energy resources to run them. Disaster. 

Power generating facilities are dependent on people who can produce and so on. 

In reality, it is a snowball, where you must ensure that it is moving and gripping to more snow than the one it falls. In management terms: Ensure that the demand doesn't surpass the production. 

Building training facilities come in at higher levels than lower. This is actually a good thing. since this prolongs the production time (dwellers are not in the factory when training) but actually works in benefit to it in the long run (skilled dweller will have lower operating expenses).

I thought installing game rooms would be a waste of time and money, but it resulted to be of great value. Since factories have lower failure rate at speed-ups which also increases happiness levels.

### Operational expenses

Operational costs are the time dwellers spend working and the resources they consume. Inventory is also counted as an operational cost.
"Money for knowledge is also operational cost if it is used to convert inventory into throughput.”  - This means that time spent for dweller training is also operational cost. If we would sell our dwellers it would become inventory.
Time in the game also runs when you lock your phone. This means you don't actually have to spend in the app. This way you avoid losing money with random attacks.

Money consumed for constructing and upgrading necessary rooms for operation is also operational cost. Money spent on changes, that don’t benefit the goal is not an operational expense.

### Throughput
If the goal is a healthy 200 dweller vault where everyone is a maxed-out 50 level individual, the throughput is a process of getting there. Throughput thereby must count for all level advances, all SPECIAL advancements and the process of gaining new inhabitants. 
Whatever effects the goal must be throughput. This means, a dweller left on a “coffee break” is actually a loss. A loss also happens, when a dweller has maxed-out his/hers SPECIAL levels and is left in the upbringing facility. 
Same way, those with low SPECIAL levels should be introduced to training. But since training facilities have their own limits, it takes time to train everyone's SPECIAL. The strategy here is to select few dwellers by their SPECIAL birth preference and train their prefered levels only. Train their luck for an extra push at speed-ups.

I mentioned that those with high levels should work near the vault door, to defend incoming attacks. Same applies to SPECIAL levels. Position those with higher levels at the door. Even if they are at lower levels. They can grow.

### Bottlenecks
Bottlenecks are not apparent at first In fact, we may not be aware of them until it’s late. The lack of resources is a problem because we cannot buy additional facilities to solve them. What we can do is change perspective and focus resources we already own to relieve bottlenecks. 

### What I learned

“to learn and not to do is not to learn. To know and not to do is really not to know” - Stephen R. Covey 
With this book and simulation, I was able to learn and apply knowledge obtained by the book. Application helped me to think in terms mentioned in the book and transfer the perspective mentioned in the book to the simulation. Trough research I have obtained basic knowledge of management and strategic planning. 

This learning opportunity exposed me to management strategy, accounting and technical writing. I have learned to apply the knowledge and extract important decisions that benefit the end goal of the simulation. 

I also learned that technical innovation may not always be the right answer for our problems. Efficiency may not affect throughput at all. Just as Alex Rogo found out that the robots, that were acquired recently and have great efficiency actually represent a bottleneck for the whole factory. They had to strategically adjust the workload and batch sizes to benefit the throughput. They even obtained an old machine that once stood at the place of the robot, just to relieve the bottleneck. Technical innovation, judged by the book, may not be the leading factor to better throughput. We often think that the latest and greatest technology may solve our problems but actually renders more problems than expected. As I found out from the simulation, attaining new buildings(rooms) only comes as a necessity than from anything else.
